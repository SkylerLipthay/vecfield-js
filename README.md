# vecfield-js

A 2-D vector field visualization tool in your web browser (ES5, `<canvas>`). It has a built-in mathematical expression lexer/parser/evaluator. It's kind of messy and limited but it was written in 2 hours!

You can [play with it here](https://skylerlipthay.github.io/vecfield-js/index.html).
